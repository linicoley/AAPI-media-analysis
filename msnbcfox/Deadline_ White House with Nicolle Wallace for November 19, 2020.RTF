President-elect Joe Biden is growing impatient with President Donald Trump`s refusal to allow his administration to cooperate in the transition, but his advisers are concerned that any legal action to try to force such cooperation could backfire, according to four people familiar with the internal discussions. Biden claims Trump fighting election results totally irresponsible. President Trump is creating chaos in final days in office.}

Consumed instead with a dangerous and unwinnable battle against the results of an election he lost to Joe Biden. Even hampering Biden`s ability to clean up his mess when he assumes office, which he will on January 20th.}

And a bewildering new revelation first reported by the A.P. and since confirmed by NBC News and others, shows how he spent at least some of his time, he`s been calling local elections officials on the phone, particularly to in Wayne County, Michigan, Trump supporters who initially refused to certify their counties vote, even though it didn`t stand a chance of being overturned.}

We`re going to talk much more about all of that, and the extraordinary aftermath that is still unfolding.

It`s another thing to say it can only be open four hours a day with X number of people. The church I go, to my Catholic Church, and a lot more than 40 percent of the people are to come into the church. Those are rational decisions. It`s not shutting down everything.

That they thought perhaps, and stop me if you`ve heard this before, that the more you would escalate this, the more the President might dig in. Well, he`s dug in anyway.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 I`d encourage you to read that story. But as usual, Joe Biden has said it very clearly himself all week. He`s been using the term embarrassing to describe this delayed thing. It`s downplaying the impact for him more talking about what it means for President Trump and his legacy. Today, he went further, he called it irresponsible. He talked about this going beyond breaking norms, this idea of trying to interfere in the electoral college. And so, I think what we`re seeing now is a very clear shift in terms of the posture of the Biden team. This is not going to resolve itself and I think they want to dial up the pressure, as you heard the President-Elect say and as we`ve been hearing from inside the transition, as well, legal option is still very much on the table. But Biden also laid out the potential risk there that it would take time. And we`re also hearing that some of the legal team in the transition thinks there`s no guarantee of success there, as well.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And so, the other thing I think, to reflect on from what we`ve seen from Biden today is the message he`s still trying to send in terms of Republicans, specifically. Today is a milestone in the transition and that for the very first time, we have seen Joe Biden speaking face to face with elected Republicans. You`ll notice Biden said that this bipartisan group of governors who we spoke with, congratulated him heartily on his win. So, trying to reinforce this idea that the election is over. That the end is certain to everyone who`s paying attention. But there is concern about the degree to which the Trump team seems willing to let tear this all down in the process, despite the outcome.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 WALLACE: Let me ask you something, Mike Memoli, Bob Bauer spearheaded a vast, extremely competent, legal operation that was ready to be offensive and defensive. And it has been successful in that -- I follow all those lawyers on Twitter. I think the Trump team is something like 0-28 in their frivolous lawsuits. But it would appear based on reporting from our friends at the Washington Post that the Rudy strategy is something entirely different. Even Rudy isn`t confident enough in what remains of his legal acumen.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And the strategy is now political. And it was sort of embodied in this pressure campaign, both against the Republican Secretary of State in Georgia who reported that Lindsey Graham called and suggested that he throw away legal absentee ballots. And then, in this extraordinary call from the President himself that left one of those county election officials so stressed with adrenaline running through her body, she said, but that they do seem to have shifted their strategy. And I guess my question is, has the Biden team shifted theirs?}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 MEMOLI: Well, I think what you`re seeing is an effort to remind the public that every time they lose a battle in court, as they`re putting it, it just reaffirms the fact that Joe Biden has won this election, and in fact, one by larger margins in some of these key states. And then President Trump did in his election four years ago, but I think that is also at the root of the concern over what merit the legal strategy in terms of the GSA issue would have for the Biden team. You know why? Because there`s no precedent for this. There`s no precedent for going to court to try to get a bureaucratic agency to affirm what the voters have made clear what the electoral college should made clear. And I think the fact that this is moving to a potential challenge of disrupting the electoral college voting process on December 14th, is what`s driving the new urgency on the Biden team.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 The other thing, of course, Nicolle, and it can`t be understated is the more that the Biden team is learning about where the pandemic is heading, the rising case levels, the real dark winter, as Biden keeps putting it, I think there is less tolerance for abiding by any delays throughout this. That`s where Biden, I think, has been most forceful, is the consequences of this. And you know this very well, think back to 2008, when we were in an economic financial crisis, during the time of transition from Bush to Obama. There was hand in glove cooperation. If anything, the Bush team did more than they needed to, to make difficult decisions, to try to give the incoming Obama team breathing room, and even inviting Obama to join President Bush at a meeting of the G20 leaders. This was unprecedented cooperation 12 years ago. Unprecedented obstruction at this point.}

Thanks for spending some time with us. Joining our conversation is Washington Post Contributing Columnist, our friend, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards and Nick Confessore, New York Times Political and Investigative Reporter. So, Donna, Joe Biden was -- President-Elect Biden was pressed in that press avail to explain his claim that this delay in the transition, delay in acknowledging the outcome of the election will cost lives, will kill people.}

But just pick up on what Mike Memoli is reporting that there is no movement in green lighting that transition, which more than the funds is the access to the data that President-Elect Biden talked about, access to the sort of stockpiles. He already said today that he will invoke the Defense Production Act, but he is clearly hindered in his ability to defeat the virus, shut down the virus and protect Americans by Donald Trump.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 DONNA EDWARDS, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, Nicolle, with every day that passes, it is increasingly clear how much of a barrier the Biden-Harris transition is facing by not having access to this data, not having access to the agencies, and not having access to the people who are running those agencies for an effective transition. The President-Elect was very careful in choosing his words, but I`m not going to be careful in choosing mine. This president is dangerous. I always believe that if he didn`t win, he would try to burn the house down. And that`s exactly what he`s doing right now. And mincing no words, people will die in this interim period.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And I think it`s really just staggering that elected Republican leaders are still fainting to be able to call attention to the President`s obstruction, and that he continues to operate. And I think he is operating illegally. But I do believe that Joe Biden is right. That amount of pressure going through the legal system isn`t going to change it. Everyone should get to know the name of General Services Administrator, Emily Murphy. Know her name because her Wikipedia page will be changed forever, as a person who stood in the way, obstructed the incoming president and the transition. And as a result, people died. Americans died because Emily Murphy refused to do her job and Donald Trump is rewarding her for it.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 WALLACE: Donna, I`ve never heard you this upset. Do you believe that the incoming team is fighting aggressively enough against a president who has always benefited from the asymmetry of his willingness and eagerness to be disgusting, to be corrupt, to be illegal, to not act like or to appear that he doesn`t care about a loss of life? Do you think that this fight is fair?}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 EDWARDS: Well, it`s my job to be upset on the outside. I don`t think it does us any good for the President-Elect, for the transition to do that. But I do think it`s important to begin to ramp up the public pressure to do something. These governors in states know that the bodies that will be lost, the lives that will be lost, will actually not be on the White House lawn. They will be in every single one of those states, all 50 states in which hundreds of thousands of people will die. And these governors know Republicans and Democrats that they need the help of the federal government, not yesterday, but today in order to make sure that their states and the people in their states survive. And so, I think it`s important to begin to ramp up -- to continue to ramp up that public pressure and the demand on this -- on this president. This president is operating unlawfully and dangerously, and it`s killing Americans.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 WALLACE: Nick Confessore, there`s some great reporting in your paper and in The Washington Post about what the President is doing. And I think Joe Biden reminded us just now why it matters. It matters because they are hindered. They don`t have access to the data about Operation Warp Speed. And Joe Biden will be what Donald Trump pretended to be or tried to play on T.V. Joe -- President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris will become wartime leaders, and they will be at war against a virus that has taken as many American lives as most wars this country`s ever been involved in, and their massive production endeavor will be to create and distribute enough vaccine to protect this country. I thought it was interesting that President-Elect Biden also talked about preparing for the next pandemic. And just these small aside comments, you`re so starkly reminded of Donald Trump`s abdication of the job he currently has, and for some reason, probably to avoid criminal prosecution, seems to want to hang on to.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 But I want to ask you about the caliber of people involved in this effort. Your colleague, Maggie Haberman was tweeting about how whatever you thought of the legal team around Donald Trump for impeachment or the Muller probe, it`s down about 20 levels from that. You`ve got some folks it`s unclear how current or skilled they are in the law, but they`re out there raising incredibly unsubstantiated and in the words of Chris Krebs, the ousted homeland security official, who protected the integrity and security of the vote was one of the most dangerous 90 minutes of television ever. So, and I think we should point out, in fairness, we didn`t show it, but Rudy Giuliani had hair dye running down his face in a stream of sweat. So, it was ugly to look at, too. What do you think this incoming team can do about basically a group of people so willing to take a wrecking ball to our democracy?}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 NICK CONFESSORE, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Although, Nicolle, what`s happening here is the last tool in the President`s toolbox for trying to stay in office. And that`s to simply use his power over people in his own party to seize control of the mechanisms of certifying an election that is over, that Joe Biden has won. And think of how we got here, Nicolle, they started by trying to make it harder for people to vote. And then, the strategy shifted to stopping people`s votes from being counted, especially the votes of Black Americans in big cities and swing states.}

\loch\af2\dbch\af2\hich\f2\strike0\ulnone\cf1 And once those votes still came in and showed that Biden had won it, they have now kind of move strategies to simply saying, it doesn`t matter. Just leave those votes out, because we claim they`re fraudulent, which they aren`t, and just, you know, certify the election in a different way. They`re grabbing a hold of a function of government, that in most circumstances, we are not even aware is operating because it`s obscure, and it functions smoothly. That`s what we`re seeing now from what`s left of the President`s team of lawyers.}

I want to add to the conversation, Tim Miller, a political director for Republican voters against Trump and a contributor to the Bulwark. Tim, I mean, on any and all of it on the President-Elect`s press conference, notably his saying today, I think for the first time, that they won`t rule out legal action. I`m really talking about the cost in human lives, the American lives of not having access to the data, not having access to Operation Warp Speed, and not being able to do what every other president has done. Even George W. Bush after 2000 -- the 2000 contested election, was able to commence with the transition.}

I`m so happy you`re taking it seriously, because so many aren`t. And I mean, so many of our former, you know, colleagues and allies, the Republican Party that are now ignoring all of this, right? They try to live in this uncanny valley where the President -- where Rudy Giuliani, you know, with the hair dye dripping down his face, you know, looking like, you know, monster family member is making these ridiculous conspiracy theories, comparing our democracy to that of Venezuela, comparing our democracy to that of China, saying that it`s rigged, saying that the vote systems were rigged.

You know, we are lucky that Joe Biden won this election clearly. Because if it was much closer than this, we would be on the precipice of a very dangerous situation right now, where they`re trying to throw out votes. And if it was close enough where they could throw votes where it would matter, this would be very dangerous and the Republican voters, the Trump voters are going to expect in the future, that these votes are thrown out.

There are only seven Republican Senators who have acknowledged the result of an American election. There are more foreign leaders than Senate Republicans who have acknowledged the result of an American election. That is a denial and a subservience and a slavishness and an anti-democratic and anti- American posture. So, not only are they not repudiated Trump, they have green-lit the scam.}

The -- you know, they`re saying that that the Biden campaign bought off the vote counting system, and that the Trump`s victory was so great that that didn`t work. So, they had to rely on a secondary scam of mail vote fraud. I mean, you can`t even explain this thing to people who live in the world of reality in a way that makes sense. And so, you know, the Republican senators are not stupid. They may be cowardly. You know, they may be bordering on traitorous, but they`re not stupid. They know that this is not true.
