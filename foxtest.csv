0,Fox News Network,,"KASIE HUNT, MSNBC HOST: Battles ahead. And the President and his allies keep fighting with false claims of voter fraud and new attacks on Republican officials in Georgia, where control of the Senate hangs in the balance.
Welcome to Monday, it`s MEET THE PRESS DAILY. I`m Kasie Hunt in for Chuck Todd. On another busy day, as the Biden transition kicks into high gear and the pandemic rages out of control. Today, for the first time, both the President-Elect and the Vice President-Elect will receive the Presidential daily brief from the White House.
Biden has announced his White House communications team, his economic team, and his inaugural committee, even as the President continues to spread false, baseless, and increasingly fanciful claims that the election results are fraudulent. Nonetheless, the work of the transition continues.
The coordinator of the White House`s Coronavirus Task Force Dr. Deborah Birx said she was hoping to begin formal conversations with Biden`s team today. We`re going to talk with a top member of President-Elect Biden`s Pandemic Task Force later on this hour. Because all of these developments involving the transition are happening against the brutal backdrop of this worsening pandemic.
Nearly 200,000 new cases were reported in a single day over the holiday weekend. Hospitalizations continue to soar, overwhelming health systems across the country. Roughly 1400 Americans are dying every day. And despite the CDC`s warning against traveling this Thanksgiving, tens of millions did so anyway, prompting a chorus of dire warnings from White House officials.

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: What we expect unfortunately, as we go for the next couple of weeks into December, that we might see a surge superimposed upon that surge that we`re already in. And you know, and when I give that message, I don`t want to frighten people except to say, it is not too late at all for us to do something about this.
JEROME ADAMS, U.S. SURGEON GENERAL: I want to be straight with the American people. It`s going to get worse over the next several weeks.
DR. DEBORAH BIRX, CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE COORDINATOR, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: We saw what happened post-Memorial Day. Now, we are deeply worried about what could happen post-Thanksgiving because the number of cases, 25,000 versus 180,000 a day. That`s where -- that`s why we are deeply concerned at.
ADM. BRETT GIROIR, MEMBER, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE: This weekend with all the travel is really concerning to all of us. About 20 percent of all people in the hospital have COVID. So, this is a really dangerous time.
HUNT (voice over): But you would think that the President would be focused on the Coronavirus considering all those warnings, but he remains focused instead on failing efforts to compel states to overturn their election results.
Arizona officials are actually meeting right now to certify their vote totals. Wisconsin is expected to certify its results in just a few hours. So, let`s dive right in. Joining me now is NBC`s Mike Memoli who is with President-Elect Biden in Wilmington, Delaware. NBC`s Carol Lee is outside the White House. And also with us, Dr. Ashish Jha, the Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health. Mike, let me start with you.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HUNT (on camera): We know that or we`re expecting the President-Elect to get his first official Presidential daily brief today from White House officials. Obviously, the pandemic is a significant global challenge, something he`s likely to learn more about, especially as we`ve considered and dealt with threats from other countries as it relates to the pandemic, whether it`s hacking, it`s cybersecurity concerns, or other problems. What do you know about what the Vice President -- or excuse me -- the President- Elect`s team is doing behind the scenes right now on this against the backdrop of this worsening pandemic?
MIKE MEMOLI, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kasie, I think you see the priority order and how they`ve been announcing the sort of the initial rollout of both cabinet officials and senior administration officials. We had the national security team last week setting the stage for the fact that the President-Elect can now see the presidential daily brief himself. Of course, this is something Biden is very familiar with.
He had access to it all eight years in the Obama administration. He digested it perhaps very differently than President Trump did. And so, that`s one of the sort of new challenges for the intelligence community is to readjust it for an incoming President.
And then, of course, tomorrow with the roll up of the economic team and central to all of these is, of course, the Coronavirus, as you heard from Dr. Birx, hoping to be able to speak with Biden and members of his team today. That`s an important relationship that now can be fully engaged given the long national nightmare of ascertainment we saw end last week.
These conversations can now finally happen. And when you see the President- Elected announced the members of his economic team tomorrow, you should expect the impact of the Coronavirus to be front and center as it is has been with most of his policy rollouts. The Biden team is looking at these rising case numbers nationwide with great alarm, in part because this is certainly going to affect the economic outlook in the years ahead, it`s going to affect the health situation that he inherits on January 20th.
And there`s very real concern, as well, of course, about the fact that President Trump seems to be completely disengaged from this challenge at this moment. And Biden also in touch with local officials, as well, as we see a number of states are considering in some cases moving towards a greater lockdown posture, New Jersey, for instance, considering something close to a statewide lockdown, potentially, as we see these case numbers rise. And so, a lot on Biden`s plate as he begins to really continue to fill out his team, both on the cabinet level and in the White House team.
HUNT: Yes, if anything, that`s an understatement. And I`m glad that that you mentioned the President and his seeming complete lack of engagement here. We have, I think, a little bit more sound from Dr. Fauci who, of course, spoke to Chuck over the weekend at MEET THE PRESS. And Carol, I`d like to show it to everyone, and then talk to you a little bit about it, because Dr. Fauci essentially seemed to say to Chuck, that he was powerless to get the President to focus on the pandemic. Let`s watch.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: How about getting the President to talk about not traveling over the holidays, or getting the President to talk about wearing a mask again? Is that possible?
FAUCI: You know, I don`t know. I mean, it certainly is possible, Chuck, I mean. But I don`t think I have any power in that regard. I mean, so what I`m doing is the best that I can do.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HUNT: The best that he can do, which of course, I think Americans across the country, of course, appreciate. But, I mean, what a statement to make. I`m -- he`s the top infectious disease expert in our government during the middle of a global pandemic, a once in a lifetime global pandemic. And he says he can`t get the President to listen to him.
CAROL LEE, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Kasie, and he`s just being honest. You know, I think anyone who works for the President, and has been trying to get him to say something about the pandemic over the course of save the last few months, when he`s really just shifted away from talking about it in a meaningful sort of way, mostly focuses on the vaccines is running into the same frustration, perhaps that that Dr. Fauci has, and he`s just essentially given up.
I mean, the President is not somebody who`s going to be out there and be the face of whatever the White House is saying and messaging on Coronavirus. It hasn`t been that way for some time.
And when I was speaking with a White House official when they were gearing up for the Thanksgiving holidays, they said that that President Trump was not going to be part of their arsenal in terms of who they put out there to try to message to Americans not to travel, to social distance, to wear masks.
And I think you`ll probably see the same thing as we head into the winter holidays, where you`ll have folks like Dr. Fauci, Vice President Mike Pence, perhaps coming out and making these sorts of recommendations while President Trump stays behind the scenes.
He has, though, focused very heavily on the vaccine. And that is because he wants credit for the vaccine development because he feels like it`s his Operation Warp Speed that is responsible for that, and that it`s his initiative. And he`s even come out and basically said he doesn`t want Joe Biden, for instance, getting credit for the vaccine. He feels like that`s something he should have.
One interesting thing, Kasie, is that, you know, during the election, the campaign, the President repeatedly said on the campaign trail that once we got through the election, everyone would stop talking about Coronavirus, and really, the only person who has stopped talking about it is the President. You see everybody around him in his administration, the transition that the Biden team is pulling together, and all Americans are dealing with this, governor, state and local officials, and the President, as you noted, just doesn`t weigh in.
HUNT: I`m glad you brought up the vaccines because I want to go to Dr. Jha on that because, obviously, we`ve been -- we`ve been covering and focused on how difficult things are right now out there, the surge on top of a surge. But one of the things people have been -- have been trying to hold on to and I`ve heard possible you -- some of your colleagues on our airwaves saying, you know, we finally have light at the end of the tunnel.
We finally have hope. Let`s just, you know, get through these few weeks, these months that we have left. We`ve done so much already. Let`s just hold out a little bit longer until we can get this vaccine. But we`ve also seen throughout the last year that convincing people to do something if you`re a public health official, convincing the public and mass to do something is a lot harder than maybe a lot of us thought.
Wearing a mask was politicized very quickly. We saw a drop off in confidence in vaccines, and questions about whether people would take them right away. And I feel like that`s the next potential messaging challenge here is convincing people that, hey, it`s safe to do this.
This is something that you should do; you have to do it. You know, there`s likely two shots one after the other. What kind of changes are we facing in terms of communicating with people about how this vaccine is going to be rolled out both how they should act before they`re able to get it, and then how they should feel, and whether they should feel comfortable about actually taking it at all?
DR. ASHISH JHA, DEAN OF THE BROWN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: Yes, so Kasie, thank you for having me on. There are a couple of points I think are worth emphasizing. Number one is, we are in for the sort of hardest six, eight weeks of the pandemic ahead of us. They`re going to be really, really tough two months. But the light at the end of the tunnel is not only there, it`s bright, and it gets brighter every day.
Both Moderna and Pfizer vaccines looked really terrific in their efficacy and looked to be quite safe. But as you have pointed out, the big challenge is helping people understand why it`s in their best interest to take the vaccine.
And what I have argued is that some of the hesitancy that we see is natural; the vaccine has been developed very quickly, and people are worried about whether we`ve cut corners or not. And the short answer is we have not cut corners. The scientific integrity with which this vaccine has been developed is very high. And when it`s my turn, I plan to get vaccinated.
And so, we have to sort of just talk very openly and honestly with people. And one of the ways we got into trouble with mask wearing, et cetera, was that there was a whole political campaign by people to undercut the public health message. And my take is I hope there isn`t such a campaign. But if there is, we`re going to have to confront that campaign, and really fight that disinformation that made it so much harder to do the basic public health stuff so far.
HUNT: No, it`s a -- it`s a very, very important point. Mike, let me come back to you, because I want to talk a little bit about the -- more about the transition. And you mentioned the economic team, which is, of course, just a critical part of trying to recover from this pandemic, once we are able to distribute the vaccines and people get back to some semblance of normal life. Obviously, just that public health piece of it goes a long way. But there`s still going to be a lot of damage, that an economic policy is going to need to be focused on.
What do we know now about -- and I know you touched on this a little bit briefly earlier, but the President -- the President-Elect`s economic team, and I`m interested, particularly also in Neera Tanden, who is slated to be the director of OMB and who`s drawn some fire from Republicans. And what the thinking is inside the Biden campaign, about whether they were expecting that kind of criticism so early and so quickly out of the gate, or whether they were surprised by it?
MEMOLI: Well, I`ve spoken with several Biden advisors about the immediate blowback we`ve seen. And two things have been observed about that. First is that an awful lot of Senate Republicans in particular who have yet to acknowledge the fact that Joe Biden won the election and is the President- Elect are reacting very strongly to some of these nominations (AUDIO GAP) a tacit acknowledgement in their view of the fact that he has won (AUDIO GAP) and Kasie, you know, this better than anybody, a lot of Senate Republicans, who for some reason, never seemed to manage to see President Trump and his tweets are highlighting a lot of Neera Tanden`s tweets, as well this morning. And so --
HUNT: Funny --
MEMOLI: -- this is, I think, a sign that they are ready -- (LAUGHTER) they are ready for a fight if it comes to. I know that we`re in a very cynical time. There`s been some discussion of whether Neera Tanden is perhaps a sacrificial lamb, somebody who`s meant to draw fire away from some of the other nominees.
One official saying that`s just not how Joe Biden operates as he wouldn`t necessarily put somebody in that position, even if that might have the effect of happening right now. But more broadly about this economic team, you`re continuing to see a President-Elect who promised to have a administration that reflects the diversity of this country, doing that with his choices.
We have, for instance, the first woman nominated to be treasury secretary. You also have a diversity (INAUDIBLE) number of the former officials who are out there, touting her today are noting that she is somebody who benefited from social welfare programs to undermine, and that she would be, in large part, charged with helping to shore up as the OMB director and working with the economic team.
And the other thing is, remember, you know, there`s been a lot of discussion about where Joe Biden fits on the ideological spectrum center versus more to the left of the party. On the economic front, it`s been interesting having observed Joe Biden over the years, that a little bit of a popular streak and Heather Boushey, who`s one of the nominees to be on the Council of Economic Advisers here came from the Economic Policy Institute.
Biden gave a speech that I think a lot of folks should look back on two years ago about his view of this, where he actually talked about the ways in which he was often at odds with the Obama administration on some economic policies, talking about ways he did not think they were focused enough on the needs of middle working class Americans.
It`s very rare for Biden to criticize the direction of the Obama administration on any front. This was obviously after they left office, but I think it`s an indication of some of the approach that he is bringing into the (AUDIO GAP) more widely.
HUNT: Really interesting point. And, Dr. Jha, let me wrap up with you and stick with this economic question, briefly. It`s going to be harder to reach communities that are -- they`re already were at a disadvantage.
We`ve been, you know, focusing on income inequality for months, if not years now. But it`s been made so much worse by the pandemic. What do we need to do broadly to try and make sure that those communities both have access to the public health resources here to deal with the pandemic explicitly, but also in the future, as you think about public health, holistically?
JHA: Yes. So, I think two things, Kasie, even the short run, we`ve just got to make this a priority, that we -- there are certain communities, communities of color, primarily, that have been disproportionately impacted by this pandemic.
And we must absolutely ensure that, for instance, when we do vaccine distribution, when we do community outreach, that those communities are not left behind, I think that`s going to be critical. The second part, the longer run, is that there are broad issues of systemic racism in our country that have landed us where we are.
And they have to be addressed, everything from housing policy to other social policies that have really created the context for the pandemic hitting certain people more than others. If we don`t address those underlying issues, we are going to be back here again. I hope we can learn the lessons and make sure we do better next time.
HUNT: All right. Dr. Ashish Jha, Mike Memoli, Carol Lee, thank you all for kicking us off this morning on a busy news day here. Coming up next, votes are being certified as accurate and fair, counter to the President`s attempts to overturn them. Arizona officials are meeting to certify those results right now. And Wisconsin is about to do the same. And later, the positive vaccine news keeps on coming. But how hard is it going to be to get it to the people who need it.
HUNT: Welcome back. We`ve got a lot of election action today, as more key states move to seal the results heading into December. You`re watching live now as Arizona completes their election certification process. It`s one of the last two battleground states to certify their results.
The other holdout, Wisconsin, is planning to certify their results later on this afternoon, following a partial recount that was requested by the Trump campaign. It confirmed Joe Biden as the winner. The Trump campaigns failure to halt the certification process in these crucial States does not mean the legal battles are over.
As the results are certified in Arizona, Rudy Giuliani and other Trump campaign lawyers are holding what they`re calling a hearing, quote, unquote, with Arizona lawmakers to discuss unproven claims of election fraud. And Trump has continued to fight with Georgia Republicans, attacking the governor and triggering a second recount, even though the state has already certified its results. The fight that could spell trouble in the two Senate run-offs that are going to decide control of the Senate.
I`m joined now by two of my NBC News colleagues, Shaquille Brewster is in Milwaukee ahead of the certification of Wisconsin`s results, and Vaughn Hillyard is in Atlanta, following the Georgia recount and Senate run-offs.
Welcome to you both. It`s always great to see you. Shaq, let me start with you since now the process in Wisconsin seems to be wrapping up. Let`s just walk through for everybody exactly what changed and what didn`t change after this recount. The Trump campaign spent $3 million on this. How much did they pay for each vote that they found, and did it actually help them?
SHAQUILLE BREWSTER, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: I`ll need to do a calculator to get that answer for you. But I`ll tell you, you know, the Trump campaign requested that recount, and just Milwaukee County and just Dane County, the two most Democratic counties of this state, and yes, they only -- you saw Vice President Biden, now President-Elect Biden, you saw his margin increased by just about 87 votes.
The bottom line, though, Kasie, is that it didn`t really change both the result of the election and President-Elect Biden still won this state by about 21,000 votes. But we did see from the President this week, and he explained a little bit of the strategy here.
Today, later this afternoon, we`ll see the chair of the Wisconsin Elections Commission certify the results here in the state of Wisconsin now that that recount has finished. That will then allow the Trump legal team to move this from a recount fight to a court battle.
They`ll have five days to appeal the results of the recount to a circuit court here in this state. The President, this weekend, suggested that`s what he will do. He says the lawsuit will come either Monday or Tuesday. And what is the team is essentially alleging there`s three objections that we heard throughout the recount process over what he calls illegal ballots. Many of these are longstanding practices that we`ve seen in the state of Wisconsin that his team is objecting to.
For example, any early in-person vote. His team believes that in these two Democratic counties, those votes should be tossed. So, you see his campaign saying that they`ll file a lawsuit to move this to the courts. The Biden team is saying this is just a massive effort to disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of voters.
We`re talking about about 200,000 votes that would be tossed if the Trump campaign and Trump legal team got their way. Bottom line, we`re getting to the end of this process. But we`re not at the end yet. We`ll expect some more court battles to come. Kasie?
HUNT: Fair enough. And I`m sorry, I didn`t -- I would never have tried to put someone on the spot to do math on television. It`s certainly not something I`m capable of doing. I could do it a little bit earlier. And it seems like Biden added 87 votes, it`s about -- it`s more than $30,000 per vote that actually Biden gained.
But thank you, Shaq, great reporting, as always. Vaughn, let me go to you in in Georgia, and I know we`re still keeping an eye in Arizona, but it sounds like we haven`t gotten quite to a certification process yet. I know you`ve been keeping an ear to the ground in your home state, as well.
But I want to talk about these Senate run-offs and the recount process, because I mean, this absolute Civil War among Republicans in the state of Georgia, the President versus now the governor and the Secretary of State.
And a lot of allegations flying on social media that Republicans are having to tamp down because there are some suggestions they shouldn`t -- voters shouldn`t go out and vote for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, the Republican Senate candidates. I mean, what a headache if you are Mitch McConnell. How is that all playing out on the ground and how nervous is it making those two Georgia Senators Loeffler and Perdue that they may lose their run-off elections to Ossoff and Warnock?
VAUGHN HILLYARD, NBC NEWS POLITICAL REPORTER: Exactly, Kasie. I think the frustrations that there are some Republicans who want this process to be over in Wisconsin or over in Arizona is different than the frustrations here in Georgia because it is distracting from the necessity for Republicans to hold on to the Senate Majority.
If in fact, the Democrats were to pull off both Senate seats here in Georgia on January 5th, run-off day, ultimately, it would be 50-50 in the Senate. And Kamala Harris presiding over the Senate would be that 51st deciding vote.
And that is why when you look ahead to this very Saturday, President Trump, he`s going to be campaigning here in the State of Georgia. But the question is, is he going to be more focused on trying to help the likes of David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, or is he going to be more focused on his frustrations with the what he says is the election integrity in a fraudulent election here in Georgia? He lost the state of Georgia by 13,000 votes.
And it`s taken to his Twitter feed to slam not only the Republican Secretary of State, but also in the last 36 hours, the Republican governor, Governor Brian Kemp. Yesterday, he said that he was ashamed that he ever endorsed him for governor back in 2018. And this morning in a series of tweets, he called him a hapless governor, essentially expressing frustration because a week and a half ago, the governor and the secretary of state, they certified the election results.
Now, we should note, the governor, his office released a statement here to NBC News earlier today, in which the governor`s office says, Georgia law prohibits the governor from interfering in the elections and said that they are going to do what it takes to restore trust and address serious issues that have been raised.
At the same time, this Wednesday will mark essentially the end of the final, final recount. And yet, it appears that no matter what the results and how many recounts take place here in the state of Georgia, the President will not be content.
And again, what Democrats are hoping for is that the President sows further distrust among Republican voters here, who you saw over the weekend, RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel was here and kind of had a town hall like gathering, and the Republican voters who threw up their hands to her and said, What`s the purpose if the election is rigged? And McDaniel was pleading with those voters to please come out and vote. And the question is, could Donald Trump be what costs the Republicans their Senate Majority?
HUNT: Well, exactly to that point, Vaughn. I mean, it`s -- I mean, it really is, in many ways, the worst nightmare for Republican officials. It`s also, obviously, for voters and incredibly frustrating place to be, but there`s some talk about whether Trump is going to go to Georgia or not, that he may be campaigning there for Purdue and Loeffler.
And, I mean, again, it illustrates the bind that they`re in, because on the one hand, they can`t win without the turnout from his base. But on the other hand, is he going to come down to Georgia and say, your votes don`t count? Why would you go, you know, vote in the Senate election, if your vote for me didn`t count this election was rigged? I mean, it`s like they can`t win with him, and they can`t win without him. So, what do you do?
HILLYARD: In January 5th, it`s only going to be two weeks before, you know, President-Elect Joe Biden`s inauguration. And if the President loses further interest in this race, you know, it could cost that enthusiasm. Early voting begins here two weeks from now, December 14th. And so, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, who both won by narrow margins here, they need to turn out that base.
And you know, both of those Senators, right now, they`re up on Capitol Hill, up where you are, Kasie, because those negotiations continue on Capitol Hill over a spending agreement with a government shutdown on the line next week, which they would you would expect to be at least held responsible for in part, at least that`s a Democratic messaging here in the state would be, as well as COVID talks.
There have not been -- there`s no been COVID package that has been passed through this Congress, which Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are presently a part of since the spring. So, right now, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, they need this President. And the question is, to what extent will he be there for them?
HUNT: All right, Vaughn Hillyard on the ground in Georgia for us, not Arizona, and Shaq Brewster in Wisconsin. Thank you, guys, both so much for your reporting today. Coming up next here, the White House`s fight to keep undocumented immigrants out of the census. Now, it`s up to the Supreme Court to decide. We`ll have the latest on today`s arguments coming up next.
HUNT: Welcome back. We`ve got a little bit of breaking news. Just moments ago Arizona officials finished up their meeting where they formally certified the state`s election results as a win for Biden. The state`s governor was in attendance for the meeting and so was the state`s attorney general. So it turns out those calls on election night that so angered the Trump campaign, here we are with Biden certified as the winner there.
But let`s go now to the Supreme Court where oral arguments have wrapped up in a major case that could have sweeping implications for how you`re represented in Congress. Justices are considering a challenge to the Trump administration`s plan to exclude undocumented immigrants from the Census. If the Trump administration gets its way, some states could lose a seat or two in Congress, and many others would lose millions of dollars in federal grants.
Here`s part of the opening statements from both sides.
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The president has at least some discretion to determine that at least some illegal aliens lack enduring ties to the states which means that the judgment should be reversed.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This policy ignores the undisputed fact that millions of undocumented immigrants have lived here for decades and have substantial community ties. Their undocumented status doesn`t erase their presence.
(END VIDEO CLIP)
HUNT: NBC News justice correspondent Pete Williams has been closely following these oral arguments which of course have been taking place virtually in the pandemic.
Pete, it`s great to see you. Can you bring us up to speed in terms of what you heard for the arguments on both sides of this case and the repercussions?
PETE WILLIAMS, NBC NEWS JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Sure. What I heard is basically the -- what you just laid out there. The Constitution says that the Census has to be conducted every 10 years precisely to figure out how many members of Congress each state gets. And by the way, that also means how many electoral votes, plus how much money they get in federal funds. And it says that the Census is to be conducted by counting the whole number of persons in each state.
So this dispute is really about what does that mean, the states and the groups that depend on the Census says that means you count everybody, if they had any ties to the place where they basically lay their heads every night. And even some conservatives of the court seem to think that the administration has the wrong argument here.
Amy Coney Barrett said if somebody has lived here, even if they`re illegally here for 20 years, doesn`t that establish that they`re people who live in the U.S., that this is their residence. So I think frankly a majority of the court is not willing to accept the Trump administration`s definition of that.
Here is the problem. What is the court supposed to do about it? And this is where today`s argument took a very strange turn. Jeffrey Wall, whom you heard just a little bit there, the acting solicitor general, said he has talked to the Census Bureau and they don`t know two things. They don`t how many people they will exclude from the Census because they can`t figure that out yet, and they also don`t know when they`ll know the answer to the question if at all.
Now, there`s a deadline to get this information to the president by the end of the year, and then he has to use it to transmit to Congress early in January the numbers that Congress is to use for reapportionment. But it`s very unclear here about what that number is going to be and when it`s going to be turned over to the White House. So while I think the majority of the court is skeptical of the president`s plan about its constitutionality, there didn`t seem to be any great appetite for acting quickly even though the court has taken this on a fast track, promising a decision by the end of the year.
My guess is that they will not block the administration in this initial decision from doing this. They`ll wait to see what happens. They`ll wait to see how many figures the Census Bureau actually gives the president, whether that would make a difference in reapportionment, and maybe then entertain new lawsuits to try to block that.
HUNT: So, Pete, I mean, it sounds like you`ve said -- you may not have the information to answer this question, but I think certainly what I`m grappling with as I think about covering Congress is OK, so let`s say in this case that they do as you suggest, that they don`t stand in the way initially. What states are likely to be most affected? What`s likely to be the real-world political implication of this? Who is going to get hurt if this is how this happens?
WILLIAMS: Sure. The winners and losers. So the states that are challenging this say basically this is an attempt by the president to shift political power away from states that have large immigrant populations -- New York, California, Texas, Florida -- and toward states that would otherwise lose a seat in Congress. So the president was quite clear about this in a memorandum that he sent to the Census Bureau in July.
He was basically saying states that don`t deal with large numbers of people who are here illegally should not be rewarded with political power. So that`s really what this is all about. But you can`t really know how many seats a state would lose until you know how many people the Census Bureau is actually going to put in that category, and what they said today at the court is that it`s not enough just to know how many people are in ICE detention or how many people are awaiting removal proceedings because they`ve committed a crime, or even how many people are in DACA or some other category. You have to then match those specific people to people who were in the Census, and that`s what the government says is taking so long and is so uncertain.
HUNT: For sure. So complicated.
All right, Pete Williams, thank you as always for taking these incredibly complicated things and explaining them so clearly to all of us.
Coming up next here, as the race for the coronavirus vaccine moves forward, we`ll talk with one of the members of the President-elect Joe Biden`s Coronavirus Advisory Board. Don`t go anywhere.
HUNT`: Welcome back. A glimmer of hope amid the gloom of this pandemic. December could be the month that sees a coronavirus vaccine gain Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. government. Moderna submitted its vaccine for FDA regulatory approval this morning after its phase three trial found it to be 94 percent effective against COVID-19. The company expects the agency to evaluate their vaccine on December 17th.
One week before that, on December 10th, the FDA is set to evaluate Pfizer`s vaccine, which was submitted for Emergency Use Authorization earlier this month. That vaccine`s phase three trials also showed a high level of efficacy. But unlike the Moderna vaccine, it requires storage at extremely cold temperatures.
While the approval process for these two candidates will likely take place during the Trump administration, the bulk of vaccine distribution will happen after Biden takes office. And they have only recently been in contact with the current White House`s Project Warp Speed.
Joining me now is a member of President-elect Biden`s COVID-19 Advisory Board, Dr. Celine Gounder. She is an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York and an assistant professor at NYU`s Grossman School of Medicine.
Dr. Gounder, thank you so much for being with us today. And let`s start with what we expected to be the first Biden transition formal briefing with the coronavirus task force namely Dr. Birx who talked a little bit about this over the weekend. Has that briefing happened yet, and if so, what can you tell us about what you learned?
DR. CELINE GOUNDER, BIDEN COVID-19 TASK FORCE: Sure. The transition team and the advisory board are in the process now of meeting with Trump White House officials including Dr. Birx. And essentially what we`re learning about is what are the distribution plans that are already in place, for example, through state and local health departments, through big pharmacy retailers, through nursing homes, and understanding the logistics of those plans, and how to make that transition as smooth as possible.
HUNT: So we know that initially the Trump administration plans to send batches of vaccines to states strictly based on population and then states are going to make decisions about how to distribute among vulnerable populations, health care workers, et cetera. Does the Biden team have any concerns about that method of distributing the vaccine, and as we go forward, are there any adjustments that you think should be made to that plan?
GOUNDER: Well, ultimately the Biden team will be deferring to scientists, doctors, epidemiologists, as to how best to prioritize allegation of the vaccine. And this week the ACIP, which is a group of such scientists at the CDC, will be issuing guidelines to help guide that distribution process, that prioritization, because we will have a limited supply of vaccine up front. It is simply not going to be possible to vaccinate everyone at the very beginning. And so you really want to make sure that you`re vaccinating for maximum impact and equity as we move forward.
HUNT: So when we get to this point where you are actually taking the reins, the Biden team is taking the reins from the Trump administration on distribution, what area should we be focused on in terms of potentially trouble spots, problem areas, places where -- you know, a transition is a huge undertaking under the best of circumstances, trying to do it in a global pandemic with a government that has been frankly reluctant to help in the ways that they`re supposed to. I mean, there`s a lot of additional challenges layered on top.
What are the potential weak spots that you think we need to be particularly on top of and focused on?
GOUNDER: Well, in terms of populations, rural populations as well as communities of color are of concern. We simply don`t have the same kinds of capacity with respect to, say, hospital systems or pharmacy retail chains in some of these rural parts of the country. And so the logistics of distributing vaccine in those areas is going to be more complicated. As for communities of color, we`ve already seen issues with testing where there are fewer testing sites, longer lines to get tested. Longer turnaround times for a test. And we certainly don`t want those same issues replicated with the rule out of a vaccine.
HUNT: So let`s talk a little bit about the next couple of months before this is all able to unfold and we`re still grappling with what seems like it`s going to be the absolute worst part of this pandemic with infections just off the charts. What should we be doing now? You`ve compared it, I think, to a dimmer switch as opposed to a full lockdown, but how would you at this point dim activity and where to try and help people get through this last bit of this horrible year, frankly?
GOUNDER: Yes. I mean, I think we`ve learned a lot since the spring. We have a much better understanding of which populations are contributing the transmission and what kinds of locations. So for example, restaurants and bars and gyms. Not so much schools are -- you know, are the major transmitters of infection. So that means trying to prioritize resources in terms of keeping places safe with personal protective equipment and ventilation for schools, for example. While perhaps having to dial down, restrict in closing indoor dining and the like.
So I think we`re trying to be much more targeted in what we restrict based on the epidemiology, but also based on where the zip codes that are the hot spots as opposed to really implementing something on a city-wide or state- wide basis.
HUNT: Dr. Fauci suggested with my colleague Chuck Todd over the weekend on "MEET THE PRESS" that we should close the bars and keep the schools open. And I think that makes a lot of sense to people. Why are we seeing some places like New York City, for example, not quite follow that edict?
GOUNDER: Well, you know, I think policy is a balance between what the science is, but also other interests. And I think that is essentially what you`ve seen play out in places like New York City where there are competing interest whether it`s small businesses who frankly have a lot at stake as well. It is a concern to their businesses. And you know, we certainly don`t want to see those folks suffering either. So I think it`s a question of balancing the economic interests and the science.
HUNT: For sure. And it`s such a difficult calculus every day.
Dr. Celine Gounder, thank you so much for being with us today. We really appreciate your insights.
And coming up next here, Congress gets back to work with a narrowing window to pass a COVID relief bill. We`re going to get an update from my colleague Garrett Haake on Capitol Hill after this.
HUNT: Welcome back. We`ve got some new reporting this afternoon about some movement in stalled talks on coronavirus relief bill. My colleague Garrett Haake is on Capitol Hill.
Garrett, it`s great to see you. We obviously have all been reporting out and talking about this, what may be the first possibly of many bipartisan gangs that we may be covering that seems to potentially be returning to the landscape on the hill after a bit of a hiatus, but in seriousness there are a lot of people out there who are really hurting. These talks have been stalled for months. We`ve gotten nowhere. There are -- there do seem to be some conversations that are happening.
What do you know about the details of that and what`s your sense so far on how serious it is? Could something actually happen here?
GARRETT HAAKE, MSNBC CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT: Well, what we`re seeing behind the scenes here is this bipartisan group of senators, about a half dozen or so, starting to get together to talk about possible coronavirus relief. That this is happening now speaks to the frustration across the Hill that no deal has been reached. That we`re essentially locked in the same place we have been since July. And among the members of that groups you see folks who are frequently invoked when we talk about these bipartisan gangs.
Joe Manchin, Susan Collins have been at the center of some moderately successful efforts around things like ending government shutdowns, trying to come up with immigration compromises before. So we know these folks who can talk to each other.
Just in the last few minutes, our colleague Leigh Ann Caldwell reports that Dick Durbin, the number two Senate Democrat, is also part of this group which bodes well because the reality of these gangs are, they`re really only going to be successful in pushing policy if they can convince their leadership to act. And right now you`ve got leadership of both the Democratic and Republican side that remains dug in on -- stop me if you`ve heard this before -- issues like state and local funding, which Democrats want to see included, and a liability shield for businesses which Republicans say is a must have.
So despite the new group having these conversations, the problems appear to be the same as they ever were.
HUNT: Same as it ever was. They do of course have to find a compromise to keep the government open. It`s going to shut on December 11th.
HAAKE: That`s right.
HUNT: What`s your sense of -- I was talking to some folks over the weekend and they sort of left open the possibility that they could potentially do some of these critical pieces that they agree on in that massive spending bill. Do you think there`s any chance that people out there who are looking at losing their unemployment benefits or who could really use a refresher on the PPP loan program, for example? I mean, is there any hope for people that they might get some relief in that must-passed bill?
HAAKE: I think it`s possible. Here`s why. Those bills I think a good way to think of it is they can refill -- lawmakers can refill buckets that already exist in terms of handing out aid, but they can`t really build new buckets that are not already there. So if you`ve got a program like PPP, if you`ve got this unemployment insurance protections that were set up, for example, for freelancers, a program set to expire at the end of the year, those kinds of things could potentially be more easily refilled without one of these big overarching deals but we`ll see what the next two weeks bring.
HUNT: It`s going to be pretty up and down. And of course we didn`t even talk about the fact that it seems to be a hot spot at the capital as well with Republicans canceling lunch after too many of their members caught coronavirus.
Garrett Haake, thanks as always. It`s great to see you.
And thanks to all of you for being with us this hour.
HAAKE: Thanks, Kasie.
HUNT: Chuck will be back tomorrow with much more MEET THE PRESS DAILY. And don`t forget, you can me every morning on "WAY TOO EARLY" at 5:00 a.m. Eastern. But don`t go anywhere, MSNBC coverage continues with my good friend, Katy Tur, coming up right after the break.
