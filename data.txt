Cory Booker ever had any real shot at the Democratic nomination for president considering the angry lust for socialism that drives Democratic politicians in Washington these days. Well, that and an unstinting hatred of President Trump.As left wing and riled up as Spartacus is, he is simply no match for the fever dreams spun by the rest of the crazies in his party, all vying for the Holy Grail.For example, take Michael Bloomberg. The white billionaire in Gucci pumps is flaying himself over every effort he made back when he was mayor of New York City to fight crime and make the city a remotely livable place.Now that he is whoring himself out and opening his wallet to buy the Democratic nomination, Mr. Bloomberg has gone to California  a blueprint, he says, for the rest of the country.\"I think that California can serve as a great example for the rest of the country,\" he said during a recent visit to the high-tax state that people are fleeing in droves.\"You have led the way on climate change, on fighting gun violence and on criminal justice. And you have, as importantly, welcomed immigrants with open arms because, unlike our president, you understand immigration doesn't threaten America. Immigration strengthens America.\"No wonder the guy is trying to buy the election. He certainly could never win an election on the issues.California a blueprint? More like a petri dish, infected with leper sores, fecal deposits and discarded bloody needles.Truly, California has become a hotel you can never check out of.But thank goodness Mr. Bloomberg is still running for the nomination of a party that is completely obsessed with the color of everybody. Now that Mr. Booker has dropped out, Mr. Bloomberg is among the only people of color left in the Democratic race, green being the color of himself and Tom Steyer, the retired hedge fund billionaire with white skin who is trying to outbid Mr. Bloomberg for the nomination.There has been debate recently  and I am not kidding  among Democrats and some in the media over whether Andrew Yang qualifies as a \"person of color\" since he is of Asian decent. Apparently, these people are not sure his \"color\" counts as a positive since it would be used against him if he applied for admission to an Ivy League university.Seriously, this is how ridiculous the Democratic Party and your media have become.In any event, the party must go on, even if no black or Hispanic candidates are included in the next debate hosted by the Democratic National Committee.Et tu, Spartacus?\u2981Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com and on Twitter on @charleshurt."}, {"date": "April 3, 2020 Friday", "source": "Daily Beast", "text": "FULL TEXTAfter spending weeks downplaying the deadly virus that now has nearly the entire U.S. under some form of lockdown, several Fox News stars are now attempting to gaslight viewers by claiming they sounded the alarms over the coronavirus all along while it was actually the media and Democrats who dismissed it.The network\u2019 most-viewed primetime host Sean Hannity has recently devoted much airtime to insisting he has \u201clways taken the coronavirus seriously,\u201ddespite no less than a month ago suggesting the pandemic might be a \u201ceep state\u201dplot to hurt the economy or, at another point, claiming concerns over the novel virus was a \u201cew hoax\u201ddesigned to \u201cludgeon\u201dTrump.Like many of his Fox colleagues, Hannity suddenly changed his tune late last month on the virus after President Donald Trump finally pivoted to treating it seriously. The Fox star and unofficial Trump adviser has since taken aim at Democrats and critics who have rightly called out his previous coverage, claiming that all along he was the one warning of the coming disaster while they were the ones turning a blind eye.But despite Hannity\u2019 perceived confidence in his coronavirus coverage, video and audio recordings do exist. The Fox star spent weeks misleadingly comparing the deadly virus to the seasonal flu while claiming Democrats were \u201coliticizing and actually weaponizing an infectious disease\u201dto \u201cludgeon\u201dTrump. (Those comments throughout February and March that Democrats were nearly identical to those infamously made by now-former Fox Business host Trish Regan, who, on March 9, with an on-air graphic blaring \u201coronavirus Impeachment Scam,\u201dinsisted the outbreak was \u201cnother attempt to impeach\u201dTrump and \u201cemonize and destroy the president.\u201dWeeks later, Regan was let go by Fox.)Comparing the novel virus to the seasonal flu, meanwhile, was a tactic Trump and his allies adopted for weeks on end to downplay the deadliness of COVID-19 and excuse the president\u2019 slow response. But that misleading comparison was thrown in Hannity\u2019 face last month during an interview with top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci.When the primetime host asked Fauci how \u201cangerous\u201dthe virus is \u201compared maybe to the regular flu,\u201dthe top doc replied, \u201cut Sean, to make sure your viewers get an accurate idea about what goes on, you mentioned seasonal flu. The mortality for seasonal flu is 0.1 [percent]. The mortality for this is about two, two-and-a-half percent. It\u2019 probably lower than that, it\u2019 probably closer to one. But even if it\u2019 one, it\u2019 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu. You gotta make sure that people understand that!\u201dBut now Hannity insists he was sober on the virus all along\u2014nd he\u2019 gone to war with any reporter who says otherwise.Having already issued a toothless threat to sue other news outlets for criticizing his coronavirus coverage, the Fox star blew his top on Wednesday, melting down over tech journalist Kara Swisher\u2019 New York Times column blaming Fox News for her mother\u2019 initial lack of concern over the virus. The president\u2019 confidant unleashed his own Trump-like tweetstorm, blasting Swisher on both his radio and television shows, and hinted that he may take her to court.\u201cne far-left media mob maniac over at The New York Times is using the virus to attack her least favorite network and yours truly,\u201dHannity blared. \u201cow, if she actually watched our coverage and cared about the truth\u2014ctually she should put a correction in her newspaper. She would know that we reported without fear from the very beginning.\u201dThe rest of his Wednesday night rant, which included a bevy of childish insults directed at other reporters and networks, largely followed a formula Hannity\u2019 has honed in recent days: Cherry-pick a handful of op-ed headlines to claim mainstream outlets downplayed the crisis in February, credit Trump\u2019 partial China travel ban for saving \u201chousands of lives,\u201dand highlight an interview he did with Fauci in January as proof he was always concerned about COVID-19.Pointing to one New York Times column from early February by a travel reporter questioning the efficacy of the travel restrictions, Hannity asked on his radio show if Swisher\u2019 mom may have been planning a trip to China. \u201caybe she had a planned trip! If she was listening to her daughter\u2019 newspaper at the time, that would have been a really, really, really dumb idea,\u201dhe yelled, adding, \u201c\u2019l put my timeline up against yours.\u201dAdditionally, the Fox News star\u2014nfamous for peddling the insidious Seth Rich conspiracy and other assorted \u201ceep state\u201dclaims involving Hillary Clinton\u2014as also now taken to framing the rest of the media as the real conspiracy theorists. In a Monday night tirade, Hannity labeled rival network MSNBC \u201conspiracy TV\u201dwhile wondering aloud\u2014ithout a hint of irony\u2014ow the public could trust \u201cutright conspiracy theorists\u201don the coronavirus.But Hannity is not the only Fox News personality to pretend he never played a role in peddling the dismissive, often-misleading coronavirus talking points he is on-record as saying.At the top of Wednesday\u2019 broadcast of The Five, Fox\u2019 popular late-afternoon chatfest, co-host Jesse Watters\u2014ho made headlines early on for his dismissive, often-cavalier attitude towards the virus\u2014ook up the Hannity line of criticizing Democrats and the media for downplaying the pandemic.In a transparent attempt to deflect criticism of Trump\u2019 handling of the pandemic, Watters praised the president for \u201clapping the travel ban on China\u201d(the only example of early action he can cite, of course, because the president subsequently dragged his feet on preparedness and claimed the virus was not going to severely affect the U.S.) and for briefly mentioning the disease in his State of the Union address in February. \u201che address that Nancy [Pelosi] ripped up afterwards,\u201dWatters added.Watters continued with the partisan shots: \u201cot too long ago, Cuomo was saying go eat out in New York City. [Bill] de Blasio had all of the schools open. Nancy Pelosi said bring your friends to Chinatown and go to the bars. Joe Biden said the travel ban was racist.\u201d(On Jan. 27, a group of 31 Democratic senators sent Trump\u2019 health secretary a letter expressing concern that the administration wasn\u2019 prepared to provide a \u201cuick, robust, and comprehensive approach to the outbreak.\u201dA day before that, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on HHS to declare a public-health emergency. The following week, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) lamented that Trump officials \u201cren\u2019 taking this seriously enough.\u201dAnd Watters fired off at the media: \u201cvery column in The New York Times, The Washington Post, downplaying this thing.\u201d( On Jan. 22, former White House ebola czar Ronald Klain wrote in the Post that we\u2019e now \u201cast the \u2018f\u2019question and squarely facing the \u2018ow bad will it be\u2019phase of the response.\u201dA day later, Yale Institute for Global Health Director Saad Omer warned in the Times that the U.S. was not ready for an outbreak, offering preparedness tips for the administration.)While the Fox News host is now attempting to broadly paint Trump critics or the media as the real coronavirus downplayers, Watters is of course on-record as explicitly telling his viewers that the coronavirus was no big deal.\u201cf I get it, I'll beat it,\u201dhe said on March 3. \u201c\u2019 not lying. It's called the power of positive thinking, and I think America needs to wake up to that.\u201dHe patted himself on the back for sitting next to an \u201csian guy\u201don the subway and ordering \u201chinese food.\u201d\u201c'm not afraid of the coronavirus, and no one else should be that afraid either,\u201cWatters declared.Even after the president finally addressed the nation on the pandemic and cities began to lock down, Watters still adopted a cavalier attitude about the disease.\u201c\u2019 taking coronavirus seriously but I\u2019 not panicking,\u201dhe declared at the top of the March 14 broadcast of his weekend show Watters\u2019World. \u201cf I get it, I get it. And I\u2019l beat it, It\u2019 not the plague. I\u2019 a healthy young guy.\u201dLater in his monologue, he compared COVID-19 to the 2009-10 H1N1 pandemic, which was highly contagious but had a low mortality rate of 0.02 percent. \u201cearly 13,000 Americans died from swine flu,\u201dWatters stated. \u201co far, just a few dozen Americans have died from coronavirus. A few dozen versus 13,000. In one year. This isn\u2019 downplaying, this is just context. Now doctors say things will get worse, but that\u2019 how it stacks up to the last big health scare.\u201dLess than three weeks after those comments, more than 6,000 Americans have died from the coronavirus, and the White House task force\u2019 most optimistic projection of the U.S. body count is between 100,000 to 240,000 deaths.At one point, as the president pivoted away from downplaying the pandemic\u2019 risks, Watters admitted on March 16 that he did not take the threat \u201ceriously\u201denough until then, days after telling Fox viewers that he would \u201ceat it\u201dand touting the then-low death toll.Despite these Fox stars\u2019protestations that they were actually the ones issuing dire warnings, there is empirical evidence that Fox News has directly influenced its (mostly older) viewers to believe that concerns about the pandemic are overblown. According to a recent Pew Research poll, 79 percent of the network\u2019 viewers feel the media has exaggerated the risks.Dozens of journalism professors, meanwhile, recently wrote an open letter to Fox News founder Rupert Murdoch and his son, Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch, accusing the network of peddling misinformation on the virus.\u201che average age of Fox News viewers is 65. It is well established that this population incurs the highest risk from the COVID-19 pandemic. In other words, Fox News viewers are at special risk from the coronavirus,\u201dthe letter read.\u201cut viewers of Fox News, including the president of the United States, have been regularly subjected to misinformation relayed by the network\u2014alse statements downplaying the prevalence of COVID-19 and its harms; misleading recommendations of activities that people should undertake to protect themselves and others, including casual recommendations of untested drugs; false assessments of the value of measures urged upon the public by their elected political leadership and public health authorities.\u201d"}]}
